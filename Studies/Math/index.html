        <h1 class="age-group">Kindergarten</h1>

        <p class="intro-text">It's the year to learn basic shapes, special words, and a little counting, adding, and subtracting.</p>

        <img class="agewise-img" src="Kiddopedia/images/kindergarten.jpg" alt="image">

        <p class="intro-text">From the first moment they look at your cooing face, babies start trying to make sense of their new reality. They’re hungry, they cry, and food arrives. In its most rudimentary form, they’re learning the essence of mathematics: logical thinking and problem solving.</p>

        <div class="pointers">

          <h1 class="heading">What your child will learn</h1>
          <p class="pointer"><strong>By the end of kindergarten, your child should be able to:</strong><br>

            1.  Count to 100 by ones (1, 2, 3..) and tens (10, 20, 30…).<br>
            2.  Use objects, like blocks, to count, add, and subtract up to 10.<br>
            3.  Identify circles, triangles, rectangles, and squares.<br>
            4.  Sort items by size, shape, weight, and length.<br>
            5.  Understand where things are located: The cat is <strong>behind</strong> you, the pirate is <strong>below</strong> deck, the rainbow is <strong>above</strong> your head, you are <strong>next to</strong> me, and the teacher is <strong>in front of</strong> the classroom.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">How to help at home</h1>
          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">1. “I can count to 100!”</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">Kids love to show you what they’ve learned, and there’s plenty to be proud of in kindergarten. Your child will learn to identify and write numbers from 0 to 20. Ask them to point to the number that shows how old they are. They’ll be able to count to 100 — the long way saying one number at a time — and the short way skipping from 10 to 20 to 30 and so on. They’ll answer questions like, “what’s after 73?” and “what’s the number before 15?” They’ll understand that the number 3 is bigger than the number 2 and that 49 is smaller than 50, which comes after it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">2. Giving and taking away</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-b">Kindergartners learn to add and subtract within 10, but not with a pencil and paper. They’ll use objects and drawings. If there are 7 toy cars in a pile on the floor and one is removed, how many are left in the pile? If Juan has 4 cookies and Michele has 2 cookies, how many cookies do they have together? It gets a bit more difficult when they’re asked how many more cookies would they need for a total of 9, but that’s okay, because that’s pretty advanced. Also, some kindergartners will understand the equations for addition and subtraction, such as 6 + 3 = 9, but it’s not essential this year.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">3. That’s a 10</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">In kindergarten, kids learn that numbers between 11 and 19 are made up of 10 plus some ones. They understand that 12 is the same as 10 and 2 more. Their teacher will use different objects to explain this, such as a giving students 16 beans and having them create one pile of 10 plus 6 individual beans. This is the first step on their path to understanding place value.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">4. More or less</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-b">Children already see the world as things that are the same and things that are different. Kindergarten is a key year for measuring, classifying, and comparing, both developmentally and in math. Your child may sort her toys into groups of animals, board games, and trucks or arrange her stuffed animals from tallest to shortest. The good news is, when your child upends a dish full of seashells onto the floor to sort the pink ones from the white ones, you’ll now know he’s practicing important math skills. <br><br>

            Students learn to compare two objects by their length, weight, and size. Who’s taller, my best friend or me? Which is heavier, this hollow ball or this solid rock? Remember when your parents marked your height on the doorjamb every year so you could see how much you grew? If you’re not doing that now, go ahead and start. It’s a great learning tradition to continue with your children.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">5. Shape shifting</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">Your kindergartner should learn to identify the four basic shapes: circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles. During the year, kids learn to differentiate triangles from rectangles, and rectangles from squares. They learn to sort shapes into groups according to their similarities and count how many there are in each group.

            <br><br>Kindergartners start learning to identify, draw, build, and sort some 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional shapes. For example, a circle drawn on paper is 2-dimensional (also known as flat), but you can hold and bounce a ball, which is a 3-dimensional sphere.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">6. Where are you?</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-b">One of the most important concepts in kindergarten is following directions, such as put your lunch boxes inside your cubby, shoes go into the basket, put your painting next to Ida’s, and please stand behind John in line. These words are new to kindergartners. They indicate where thing are in space. Not only are they crucial for doing what the teacher asks, they’re also important math terms. Other words your child should learn sooner rather than later? <strong>Below, above, beside, in front, on top,</strong> and <strong>under</strong>.</p>

        <h1 class="age-group_">First Grade</h1>

        <p class="intro-text_">First graders absorb exciting math facts by playing with blocks, measuring objects, and knowing some place values.</p>

        <img class="agewise-img_" src="Kiddopedia/images/first-grade.webp" alt="image">

        <p class="intro-text_">Remember the shape puzzles your child toyed with — using triangles to make squares and rectangles? Turns out, that was good practice for first grade math.</p>

        <div class="pointers">

          <h1 class="heading_">What your child will learn</h1>
          <p class="pointer_"><strong>By the end of first grade, here are the 11 math skills your child should learn:</strong><br>

            1.Counting to 120 — starting anywhere, like from 3 or 72.<br>
            2.Adding and subtracting numbers up to 20.<br>
            3.Knowing that this sign “=” means equal.<br>
            4.Solving word problems with three one-digit numbers (e.g. 2 + 3 + 9) that add up to 20 or fewer.<br>
            5.Understanding why addition and subtraction are the reverse of each other.<br>
            6.Adding up to 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number (e.g. 82 + 7).<br>
            7.Knowing how to add two-digit numbers based on place value.<br>
            8.Adding or subtracting 10 using mental math (e.g. 31 plus 10 is 41).<br>
            9.Starting to measure things, such as figuring out how many of his footprints can fit into his dad’s footprint.<br>
            10.Telling and writing time to the hour and half-hour (e.g. 1:00 pm and 1:30 pm).<br>
            11.Putting two shapes together to create a new shape, and dividing shapes into two and four parts.  </p>

          <h1 class="heading_">How to help at home</h1>
          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">1. I’ll take math for 120, please</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-a">Counting to 100 — that’s for kindergartners. First graders count to 120, but the catch is that they can start from any number, like 72, and count up to 73, 74, 75, and so on. Kids also learn to subtract numbers up to 20, like 19 – 7 = 12. Students learn to solve word problems using objects, drawings, and, yes, even equations. For example, if Ted has 4 pencils, Danielle has 6 pencils, and Vicki has 9 pencils, how many pencils do they have all together?<br><br>
            Your first grader may first draw this problem and count the pencils, but by the end of the year she’ll know the equation — and how to solve it.<br><br>
          First graders also learn the relationship between counting, addition, and subtraction. For example, counting from 1 to 2 is the same as adding 1 + 1. Adding one more means counting up one, and adding two more means counting up two, and so on. Likewise, subtraction can be thought of as counting down or backward. Taking that a step further, kids learn to think of subtracting as the reverse or “undoing” of adding. So, for example, if 15 + 4 = 19, then 19 – 4 = 15. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">2. Everything in its place</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b">In kindergarten, your child started to learn about place value using tens and ones. In a two-digit number like 19, the 1 represents the tens and the 9 represents the ones. Now, your first grader will build on that by learning to add a two-digit number, like 54, and a one-digit number, like 5, or two-digit number that’s a multiple of 10, like 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.<br><br>

            One strategy your child will learn is to add the tens and ones separately.<br><br>

            For example: 54 + 5 = 50 + 0 = 50 and 4 + 5 = 9 for a total of 59.<br><br>

            And sometimes, it’s necessary to create a ten from the ones.<br><br>

            For example: 54 + 7 = 50 + 0 = 50 and 4 + 7 = 10 + 1. Move the 10 to the tens, so it’s 50 + 10 = 60 and 1 for a total of 61.<br><br>

            Your child will also be expected to figure out in her head — without counting — how to find 10 more or less than another number. If Jemma has 68 lollipops and gives away 10, she should know that’s the same as subtracting one group of tens, leaving her with 58 lollipops.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">3. How does this measure up?</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-a">First graders should be able to explain how long two objects are by comparing them to a third object. For example, the first piece of paper is shorter than the second piece, but longer than the third.<br><br>

            Kids start applying the concept of addition to measuring things. Let’s say your child uses the dog’s tail to measure the length of a blanket; he might find that the blanket is 5-and-a-half tails long. This is great practice for when the kids start using rulers.<br><br>

            First graders also learn to tell time (and write it down correctly, like 1:30 pm) to the nearest hour and half-hour by reading both digital clocks and the old-fashioned round clocks with minute and hour hands.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">4. Getting into shapes</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b">First graders delve into the properties of shapes by combining two shapes to form a new one, such as putting two triangles together to make a square or rectangle. They’ll do this on paper (2 dimensional) and with objects (3 dimensional). <br><br>

            Kids also learn to divide shapes into or two or four equal parts and learn the words for those parts: halves and quarters (or fourths).<br><br>
          So break out the blocks and Legos and have a blast while you can still practice all of your child’s math skills at home while playing on the floor. </p>

        <p class="intro-text">Second graders can now count to 1,000 by 1s, 5s, 10s, and 100s! Plus they can measure in metric and “American” units and count money.</p>

        <img class="agewise-img_" src="Kiddopedia/images/second-grade.jpg" alt="image">

        <p class="intro-text">This is the perfect year to start teaching your child that time is money. Second graders build on their knowledge of measurements and place value to include dollars and cents.</p>

        <div class="pointers">

          <h1 class="heading">What your child will learn</h1>
          <p class="pointer"><strong>By the end of second grade, here are the 7 math skills your child should learn:</strong><br>

            1. Adding and subtracting within 100.<br>
            2. Understanding even and odd numbers.<br>
            3. Understanding place value up to 1,000.<br>
            4. Using and comparing standard units of measure, such as inches and centimeters.<br>
            5. Creating picture graphs, bar graphs, and number line plots.<br>
            6. Solving word problems involving money and understanding what the symbols for dollars ($) and cents (¢) mean.<br>
            7. Identifying shapes and describing them based on specific traits.

          <h1 class="heading">How to help at home</h1>
          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">1. Array of light</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">Second graders become experts in addition and subtraction, being able to quickly and accurately add and subtract one- and two-digit numbers with sums up to 100. They’re also expected to memorize all the sums of adding two one-digit numbers.<br><br>
              For example: 5 + 4 = 9 and 8 + 9 = 17.<br><br>

              Your child needs to use drawings and equations to solve one- and two-step word problems. Second graders use addition equations to find the total number of objects arranged in rows and columns, known as rectangular arrays.<br><br>
              For example: In this rectangular array, each row contains 4 stars and each column contains 2 stars. The equation for this could be either 4 + 4 = 8, or 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.<br><br>


              Things get odd in second grade, with numbers that is. Students learn about odd and even numbers by pairing items or counting by twos.

           </p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">2. 5, 10, 15, 20 …</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-b">Second graders should be able to count up to 1,000 — the regular way and counting by 5s, 10s, and 100s.<br><br>

              Kids extend their understanding of place value to include the hundreds place. The number 352, for example, is made up of 3 hundreds, 5 tens, and 2 ones. Your child will learn to read and write three-digit numbers in a variety of ways.<br><br>

              For example: 999 = 900 + 90 +9. It also equals 9 hundreds + 9 tens + 9 ones. Additionally, students learn to spell it out as nine hundred ninety-nine.<br><br>

              Second graders use place value, drawings, and models to add and subtract within 1,000 by adding the hundreds, tens, and ones separately. They’ll use this strategy to add as many as four two-digit numbers.<br><br>

              Example: 42 + 15 + 30 + 11 = (40 + 10 + 30 + 10) + (2 + 5 + 0 + 1) = 90 + 8 = 98</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">3. How do you measure up?</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">In second grade, students use rulers, yardsticks, and measuring tapes to learn the standard units of measure: inches, centimeters, feet, and meters.<br><br>

            A student project may look like this: measure every student in the class in inches and centimeters and draw a bar graph, picture graph, or line plot to compare the lengths.

            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">4. Show me the money</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-b">Word problems get more complex this year. Not only will the second grader use addition and subtraction to solve word problems involving lengths (all within 100), they’ll tackle money math problems involving dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Officially, this is the year kids are expected to learn the dollar and cents signs.<br><br>

            For example: 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 28¢ = $0.28.<br><br>

            Your child will also watch the clock, learning to tell and write time to the nearest five minutes on digital and analog clocks.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="">
            <h2 class="pointer-heading">5. Round peg, square hole</h2>
            <p class="pointer pointer-a">

            Geometry takes many shapes in second grade. Your child will be asked to draw and identify the characteristics (think: number of sides or angles) of triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.<br><br>

            Second graders explore the concepts of area and volume by dividing rectangles into same-size squares and counting them to find the total number.<br><br>


            Some early concepts of fractions come into play, too, as students divide circles and rectangles into two, three, and four equal parts and describe them using the words halves, thirds, and fourths or quarters.<br><br>

            Do you give your child an allowance? This may be the last year to fudge on what you owe before your child understands that a single dollar bill is actually worth more than 2 quarters. Then again, it’s also an opportunity to help him really understand the concepts of quarters and halves.</p>

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">1. Multiply, divide, and conquer math</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-a">Some things have to be committed to memory: name, address, date of birth — and the multiplication tables from 1 to 10. So much of math involves multiplication that your child needs instant recall of these products, from 1 x 1 = 1 to 10 x 10 = 100.<br><br>



            Beyond memorization, third graders need to understand multiplication as a way of finding the total number of objects without counting each one separately. Think of it as a quicker, more efficient way of adding.<br><br>

            For example: If Jessica has 4 boxes that are each stuffed with 7 teddy bears, how many teddy bears does she have? Jessica could dump them on the floor and count one by one, she could add 7 + 7 + 7 + 7, or she could multiply the number of boxes by the number of teddy bears in each box and quickly arrive at the answer, 4 x 7 = 28 teddy bears, in seconds. Being able to get that quick answer is nice, but it’s much more crucial that your child understand how and why all three methods work to get the same answer.<br><br>

            Just as your first grader learned to think of subtraction as the reverse or “undoing” of addition, your third grader needs to understand that division is like the reverse of multiplication. If multiplication is combining things, then division is breaking them apart into equal-sized groups. Math will make a lot more sense if your child understands the relationship between these two important operations.<br><br>

            For example: If 9 x 8 = 72, then 72 ÷ 8 = 9.<br><br>

            Third graders start learning the basics of algebra through multiplication and division by substituting an X for an unknown number and reversing the operation to solve for X.<br><br>

            For example: To solve 6 x X = 24, your child would divide 24 ÷ 6 = X. (And, if your child has memorized the multiplication tables, then she’ll know right away that X = 4.)

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">2. The two-step with word problems</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b">Third graders now mainly solve two-step word problems that require using any of the four operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division — to solve.<br><br>

            For example: If 3 children pick 4 apples each, and then the group eats a total of 6, how many apples are left? Step 1: 3 children x 4 apples = 12 apples. Step 2: 12 apples – 6 apples = 6 apples left.</p>

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">3. Rounding off</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-a">Third graders learn to round whole numbers up or down to the nearest tens or hundreds place.<br><br>

            For example: Round 62 to the nearest ten. (It’s 60.) Round 287 to the nearest hundred. (It’s 300.)<br><br>

            Your child will also add and subtract within 1,000 and learn the pattern for multiplying numbers by 10: adding a zero.<br><br>

            For example: If 6 x 6 = 36, then 6 x 60 = 360. See, not so intimidating now.</p>

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">4. Fractions matter</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b"><strong>These are the main things your child will learn about fractions in third grade:<br> </strong>

            1. Fractions are numbers and can be shown on a number line.<br>

            2. Fractions represent equal parts of a whole object or shape.<br>

            3. Whole numbers can be expressed as fractions: For example: 4 = 4⁄1 and 1 = 4⁄4.<br>
            4. Fractions with different numerators (top number) and denominators (bottom number) can be equal:For example: 1⁄2 = 2⁄4 , 6⁄8 = 3⁄4.</p>

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">5. Hit the snooze button</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b">Your third grader gets precise about the time, solving addition and subtraction word problems about time and telling time to the nearest minute.<br><br>

            For example: Jane’s alarm clock goes off at 7:00 a.m., but she doesn’t get out of bed until 8:25 a.m. How much longer did she sleep?

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">6. A picture is worth a lot of numbers</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-a">Third graders learn to draw picture graphs and bar graphs to compare numbers in word problems that ask how many more or how many fewer objects there are in one category than in another.<br><br>

            Third graders measure the length of objects to the half and quarter inch and show the different lengths on a plot line.</p>

            <h2 class="pointer-heading_">7. Farm fresh eggs in a quadrilateral</h2>
            <p class="pointer_ pointer-b">Third graders start using multiplication to find the area of a shape by multiplying length times the width. Kids expand their understanding of shapes based on shared properties. For example, not all four-sided shapes, called quadrilaterals, are squares and rectangles: some are kite shaped and some, like trapezoids, have four sides with different lengths. Your child will be asked to solve real-world problems to find the perimeter of these different shapes, too, by adding the lengths of all four sides.<br><br>

            For example: The chicken pen Gabriela’s dad is building needs a fence. The four sides measure 20 feet, 8 feet, 14 feet, and 16 feet. How much chicken wire does Gabriela’s dad need to buy?
