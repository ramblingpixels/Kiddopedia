          7. As opposed to other cat family members like lions and leopards who hunt at night, cheetahs are able to hunt only during the day.<br><br>
          8. Cheetahs have blunt claws and a light body weight, which makes them vulnerable to their enemies. They generally give up if larger animals confront them during a fight or a hunt, due to these physical restrictions.<br><br>
          9. Cheetahs have a poor night vision, which prevents hunting at night. They are also unable to climb trees due to their blunt claws, giving them a distinct disadvantage during hunting.<br><br>
          10. A cheetah is recognisable by its dark lines, known as tear lines, that run from each eye towards the mouth. These tear lines protect the cheetah from the sun and give it long-distance vision that’s necessary during hunting or protection from other predators.<br><br>
          11. Cheetahs don’t stalk their prey. They simply creep up on them and chase them, which lasts for 20- 30 seconds.</p>
