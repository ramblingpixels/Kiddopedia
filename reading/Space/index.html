            <p class="pointer para">An asteroid speeds down into the Earth’s stratosphere every year, but luckily, it burns up to smithereens before it reaches the atmosphere. Lucky for us! Here’s another fun fact about asteroids- the first asteroid was discovered in 1801 by an Italian Mathematician and Astronomer called Giuseppe Piazza. The asteroid was known as ‘Ceres.’ Most asteroids are composed of rocks and metals.</p>

            <p class="pointer even-pointer">There are tire tracks and signs of mankind’s footsteps on the Moon. The reason for this is because no winds blow on the moon.</p>

            <p class="pointer">It takes more than a million Earth-sized planets to fill up the sun! Not just that but the sun is considered approximately 300000 times larger than the earth and is 14.9 billion km away! It has been forecasted that there will come a day when the Earth will be consumed by the sun.</p>

            <p class="pointer even-pointer">The first manmade object to enter space was launched by a Russian satellite named Sputnik back in 1957! ‘Sputnik 2’ was launched by the USSR on November 3, 1957, and a homeless dog named ‘Laika’ was launched along with it. Laika was the first dog to enter space but passed away unfortunately since the satellite couldn’t make it back to Earth.

            <img src="images/space5.jpeg" class="img" alt="">
            <p class="pointer">It’s a fascinating fact indeed that the sun’s rays bounce off of the Moon’s surface which later is passed on to the Earth, thus making it appear as if the moon is glowing. What makes this even more fascinating? It takes only 1.25 seconds for the moon to do just that!<br><br>

              Additionally, since we move a very small distance on the Earth, it appears as if the moon is following us.</p>

            <p class="pointer even-pointer">Do you love spaghetti? Well, that’s what any human will turn into once he lands inside a black hole in space. ‘Spaghettification,’ is when you’re literally, we quote, “pulled and ripped apart” by gravitational forces when landing inside a black hole. This makes it impossible for lifeforms to survive in black holes.</p>

            <p class="pointer">The Earth rotates on an invisible axis and orbits around the sun just like the other seven planets in the Solar System. Day and night occur depending on which side of the earth faces the sun. The Earth takes 24 hours to make one complete rotation which leads to days and nights on our planet.</p>

            <p class="pointer even-pointer">Previously, Pluto used to be considered a planet just like the rest of the remaining ones in our solar system. Pluto wasn’t large enough to be considered a planet and hence, was dubbed, as a ‘dwarf planet.’ This is why there are eight planets in the solar system and not nine anymores.</p>

            <p class="pointer">There are lots of natural phenomena occurring on the Earth all year round like erosions, tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters which constantly lead to the reformation of the Earth’s surface. The Moon doesn’t have this going for her which is why the Moon has got a lot of craters and scars in comparison to the Earth.</p>

            <p class="pointer even-pointer">The size of a meteorite ranges between the speckle of dust to 10 meters in diameter! We refer to giant meteoroids as asteroids. When solid debris from space enters the Earth’s atmosphere and lands on the surface, we call it a meteorite. On the other hand, if it burns up midway when falling through the atmosphere before reaching the surface, we call it a meteor.</p>

            <p class="pointer">Black holes are regions of space where no light or particulate matter can escape the space. This phenomenon is due to the intense gravitational pull of these so-called ‘Black Holes’ which makes it impossible for even light rays or electromagnetic radiations to pass through.</p>

NASA scientists discovered signs of this spacecraft again in 2003. What makes this discovery astounding is the fact that it normally takes 2 million years to reach Aldebaran.
