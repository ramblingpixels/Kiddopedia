      </div>
        <p id="title-text">The activities are meant to be used in addition to reading with children every day.<br><br>

        In using these activities, your main goal will be to develop great enthusiasm in the reader for reading and writing. You are the child's cheerleader. It is less important for the reader to get every word exactly right. It is more important for the child to learn to love reading itself. If the reader finishes one book and asks for another, you know you are succeeding! If your reader writes even once a week and comes back for more, you know you have accomplished your beginning goals. </p>

          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 1: Books and babies</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">Babies love to listen to the human voice. What better way than through reading!</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1.  Some books written especially for babies (books made of cardboard or cloth with flaps to lift and holes to peek through).<br>
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1.  Start out by singing lullabies and folk songs to your baby. When your baby is about six months old, choose books with brightly colored, simple pictures and lots of rhythm in the text. (Mother Goose rhymes are perfect.) Hold your baby in your lap so he/she can see the colorful pages of the book. Include books that show pictures and names of familiar objects.<br><br>
              2. As you read with your baby, point out objects in the pictures and make sure your baby sees all the things that are fun to do with books. (Pat the Bunny by Dorothy Kunhardt is a classic touch-and-feel book for babies.)<br><br>
              3. Vary the tone of your voice with different characters in the stories, sing nursery rhymes, make funny faces, do whatever special effects you can to stimulate your baby's interest.<br><br>
              4. Allow your child to touch and hold cloth and sturdy cardboard books.<br><br>
              5. When reading to a baby, keep the sessions brief but read daily and often.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="final-point">As you read to your baby, your child is forming an association between books and what is most loved – your voice and closeness. Allowing babies to handle books deepens their attachment even more.</p>

          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 2: Tot talk</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">What's "old hat" to you can be new and exciting to toddlers and preschoolers. When you talk about everyday experiences, you help children connect their world to language and enable them to go beyond that world to new ideas.
          </p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1.  Yourself and your child.<br>
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. As you get dinner ready, talk to your child about things that are happening. When your 2- or 3-year-old "helps" by taking out all the pots and pans, talk about them. "Which one is the biggest?" "Can you find a lid for that one?" "What color is this one?"<br><br>
              2. When walking down the street and your toddler or preschooler stops to collect leaves, stop and ask questions that require more than a "yes" or "no" answer. "Which leaves are the same?" "Which leaves are different?" "What else grows on trees?"<br><br>
              3. Ask "what if" questions. "What would happen if we didn't shovel the snow?" "What if that butterfly lands on your nose?"<br><br>
              4. Answer your child's endless "why" questions patiently. When you say, "I don't know, let's look it up," you show how important books are as resources for answering questions.<br><br>
              5. After your child tells you a story, ask questions so you can understand better. That way children learn how to tell complete stories and know you are interested in what they have to say.<br><br>
              6. Expose your child to varied experiences – trips to the library, museum, or zoo; walks in the park; or visits with friends and relatives. Surround these events with lots of comments, questions, and answers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="final-point">Talking enables children to expand their vocabulary and understanding of the world. The ability to carry on a conversation is important for reading development. Remember, it is better to talk too much rather than too little with a small child.</p>

        <!-- 3 -->
        <div class="">
          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 3: R and R – repetition and rhyme</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">Repetition makes books predictable, and young readers love knowing what comes next.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Books with repeated phrases (Favorites are: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst; Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin, Jr.; Horton Hatches the Egg by Dr. Seuss; and The Little Engine That Could by Watty Piper.<br><br>
              2. Short rhyming poems.
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1.  Pick a story with repeated phrases or a poem you and your child like. For example, read:<br>
                  (Wolf voice:) "Little pig, little pig, let me come in."<br>
                  (Little pig:) "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."<br>
                  (Wolf voice:) "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"<br><br>
              2. After the wolf has blown down the first pig's house, your child will soon join in with the refrain.<br><br>
              3. Read slowly, and with a smile or a nod, let your child know you appreciate his or her participation.<br><br>
              4. As the child grows more familiar with the story, pause and give him or her a chance to fill in the blanks and phrases.<br><br>
              5. Encourage your child to pretend to read, especially books that contain repetition and rhyme. Most children who enjoy reading will eventually memorize all or parts of a book and imitate your reading. This is a normal part of reading development.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="final-point">When children anticipate what's coming next in a story or poem, they have a sense of mastery over books. When children feel power, they have the courage to try. Pretending to read is an important step in the process of learning to read.</p>
        </div>

<!-- 4 -->
        <div class="">
          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 4: Poetry in motion</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">When children "act out" a good poem, they learn to love its rhyme, rhythm, and the pictures it paints with a few well-chosen words. They grow as readers by connecting feelings with the written word.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1.  Poems that rhyme, tell a story, and/or are written from a child's point of view.<br>
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Read a poem slowly to your child, and bring all your dramatic talents to the reading. (In other words, "ham it up.")<br><br>
              2. If there is a poem your child is particularly fond of, suggest acting out a favorite line. Be sure to award such efforts with delighted enthusiasm.<br><br>
              3. Suggest acting out a verse, a stanza, or the entire poem. Ask your child to make a face the way the character in the poem is feeling. Remember that facial expressions bring emotion into the performer's voice<br><br>
              4. Be an enthusiastic audience for your child. Applause is always nice.<br><br>
              5. If your child is comfortable with the idea, look for a larger setting with an attentive, appreciative audience. Perhaps an after-dinner "recital" for family members would appeal to your child.<br><br>
              6. Mistakes are a fact of life, so ignore them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="final-point">Poems are often short with lots of white space on the page. This makes them manageable for new readers and helps to build their confidence.</p>
        </div>

<!-- 5 -->
        <div class="">
          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 5: Story talk</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">Talking about what you read is another way to help children develop language and thinking skills. You won't need to plan the talk, discuss every story, or expect an answer.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Storybooks
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Read slowly and pause occasionally to think aloud about a story. You can say: "I wonder what's going to happen next!" Or ask a question: "Do you know what a palace is?" Or point out: "Look where the little mouse is now."<br><br>
              2. Answer your children's questions, and if you think they don't understand something, stop and ask them. Don't worry if you break into the flow of a story to make something clear. But keep the story flowing as smooth as possible.<br><br>
              3. Talking about stories they read helps children develop their vocabularies, link stories to everyday life, and use what they know about the world to make sense out of stories.

          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 6: Now hear this</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">Children are great mimics. When you tell stories, your child will begin to tell stories, too.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Your imagination
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Have your child tell stories like those you have told. Ask: "And then what happened?" to urge the story along.<br><br>
              2. Listen closely when your child speaks. Be enthusiastic and responsive. Give your child full attention.<br><br>
              3. If you don't understand some part of the story, take the time to get your child to explain. This will help your child understand the relationship between a speaker and a listener and an author and a reader.<br><br>
              4. Encourage your child to express himself or herself. This will help your child develop a richer vocabulary. It can also help with pronouncing words clearly.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p  class="final-point">Having a good audience is very helpful for a child to improve language skills, as well as confidence in speaking. Parents can be the best audience a child will ever have.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="">
          <h2 class="act-heading">Activity 7: TV</h2>

          <p class="intro-text">Television can be a great tool for education. The keys to successful TV viewing are setting limits, making good choices, taking time to watch together, discussing what you view, and encouraging follow-up reading.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. A weekly TV schedule
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer"><br>
              1. Limit your child's TV viewing and make your rules and reasons clear. Involve your child in choosing which programs to watch. Read the TV schedule together to choose.<br><br>
              2. Monitor what your child is watching, and whenever possible, watch the programs with your child.<br><br>
              3. When you watch programs with your child, discuss what you have seen so your child can better understand the programs.<br><br>
              4. Look for programs that will stimulate your child's interests and encourage reading (such as dramatizations of children's literature and programs on wildlife and science.)<br><br>

            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="final-point ">Many experts recommend that children watch no more than 10 hours of TV each week. Limiting TV viewing frees up time for reading and writing activities.<br><br>

            It is worth noting that captioned TV shows can be especially helpful for children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, studying English as a second language, or having difficulty learning to read.</p>

            <h1 class="heading heading_">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Paper<br>
              2. Pencils, crayons, markers <br>
              3. Glue <br>
              4. Newspapers, magazines <br>
              5. Safety scissors
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading heading_">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Hang posters of the alphabet on the bedroom walls or make an alphabet poster with your child. Print the letters in large type. Capital letters are usually easier for young children to learn first.<br><br>
              2. Label the things in your child's pictures. If your child draws a picture of a house, label it with "This is a house." and put it on the refrigerator.<br><br>
              3. Have your child watch you write when you make a shopping list or a "what to do" list. Say the words aloud and carefully print each letter.<br><br>
              4. Let your child make lists, too. Help your child form the letters and spell the words.<br><br>
              5. Look at newspapers and magazines with your child. Find an interesting picture and show it to your child as you read the caption aloud.<br><br>
              6. Create a scrapbook. Cut out pictures of people and places and label them.<br><br>
              7. By exposing your child to words and letters often, your child will begin to recognize the shapes of letters. The world of words will become friendly.

            </p>

            <h1 class="heading heading_">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Ask your child to dictate a story to you. It could include descriptions of your outings and activities, along with mementos such as fall leaves and flowers, birthday cards, and photographs. Older children can do these activities on their own.<br><br>
              2. Use a chalkboard or a family message board as an exciting way to involve children in writing with a purpose.<br><br>
              3. Keep supplies of paper, pencils, markers, and the like within easy reach.<br><br>
              4. Encourage beginning and developing writers to keep journals and write stories. Ask questions that will help children organize the stories, and respond to their questions about letters and spelling. Suggest they share the activity with a smaller brother, sister, or friend.<br><br>
              5. Respond to the content of children's writing, and don't be overly concerned with misspellings. Over time you can help your child concentrate on learning to spell correctly.<br><br>
              6. When children begin to write, they run the risk of criticism, and it takes courage to continue. Our job as parents is to help children find the courage. We can do it by expressing our appreciation of their efforts.

            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>

            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Ask friends, neighbors, and teachers to share the titles of their favorite books.<br><br>
              2. Visit your local public library, and as early as possible, get your child a library card. Ask the librarian for help in selecting books. Have your child join you in browsing for books and making selections.<br><br>
              3. Look for award-winning books. Each year the American Library Association selects children's books for the Caldecott Medal for illustrations and the Newbery Medal for writing.<br><br>
              4. Check the book review section of the newspapers and magazines for the recommended new children's books.<br><br>
              5. If you and your child don't enjoy reading a particular book, put it aside and pick up another one.<br><br>
              6. Keep in mind that your child's reading level and listening level are different. When you read easy books, beginning readers will soon be reading along with you. When you read more advanced books, you instill a love of stories, and you build the motivation that transforms children into lifelong readers.

              1. Listen carefully as your child reads.<br><br>
              2. Take turns. You read a paragraph and have your child read the next one or you read half the page and your child reads the other half. As your child becomes more at ease with reading aloud, take turns reading a full page. Keep in mind that your child may be focusing more on how to read the words than what they mean, and your reading helps to keep the story alive.<br><br>
              3. If your child has trouble reading words, you can help him or her in several ways:<br><br>
              4. Be an enthusiastic audience for your child. Applause is always nice.<br>
                 a. Ask the child to skip over the word, read the rest of the sentence, and then say what would make sense in the story for the missing word.<br>
                 b. Guide the child to use what he or she knows about letter sounds.<br>

            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Tell your child stories about your parents and grandparents. You might even put these stories in a book and add old family photographs.<br><br>
              2. Have your child tell you stories about what happened on special days, such as holidays, birthdays, and family vacations.<br><br>
              3. Reminisce about when you were little. Describe things that happened at school involving teachers and subjects you were studying. Talk about your brothers, sisters, or friends.<br><br>
              4. Write a trip journal with your child to create a new family story. Recording the day's events and pasting the photographs into the journal ties the family story to a written record. You can include everyday trips like going to the market or the park.<br><br>
              5. It helps for children to know that stories come from real people and are about real events. When children listen to stories, they hear the voice of the storyteller. This helps them hear the words when they learn to read aloud or read silently.

          <p class="intro-text intro-text_">Something important happens when children receive and write letters. They realize that the printed word has a purpose.</p>

          <div class="pointers">

            <h1 class="heading heading_">What you'll need:</h1>
            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Paper <br>
              2. Pencil, crayon, or marker
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading heading_">What to do:</h1>
            <p class="pointer pointer_"><br>
              1. Send your child little notes (by putting them in a pocket or lunch box, for example). When your child shows you the note, read it aloud with expression. Some children will read the notes on their own.<br><br>
              2. When your child expresses a feeling or a thought that relates to a person, have your child write a letter. Have your child dictate the words to you if your child doesn't write yet. For example: <br><br>
                  Dear Grandma, <br>
                  I like it when you make ice cream. It's better than the kind we buy at the store.<br><br>

                  Your grandson, <br>
                  Darryl <br><br>

                  P.S. I love you <br><br>
              3. Ask the people who receive these notes to respond. An oral response if fine – a written response is even better.<br><br>
              4. Explain the writing process to your child: "We think of ideas and put them into words; we put the words on paper; people read the words; and people respond."

          <p  class="final-point final-point_">Language is speaking listening, reading, and writing. Each element supports and enriches the others. Sending letters will help children become better writers, and writing will make them better readers.</p>
